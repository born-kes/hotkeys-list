## Short description
The task of this project is to testing the usefulness of the comit history.
It is created by adding keyboard shortcuts to the repository and messages describing each comit.
The database of shortcuts can be useful and reusable, so we wrapped each shortcut in a "t" function, which gives the possibility to change the behavior.
